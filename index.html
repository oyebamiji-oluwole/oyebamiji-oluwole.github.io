    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Oluwole was formerly a Senior statistician at HR Wallingford (formerly Hydraulics Research) in Wallingford and part of the Data Science team where he provided statistical support and consultation on several innovative and impactful projects. He has also worked as a senior research associate in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University on the Data Science for the Natural Environment (DSNE) project. A joint project between Lancaster University and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), EPSRC-Funded. His research was at the interface of environmental modelling using statistical machine learning and computational methods in addressing environmental grand challenges in air quality and land-use management.
Prior to joining Lancaster University, Oluwole worked as a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Newcastle University where he developed novel surrogate-based techniques for incorporating microscale biological processes in a computationally efficient way into engineered macroscale models using advanced statistical techniques.</p>
